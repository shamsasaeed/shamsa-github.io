## Art Gallery Musuem 

## Inspiration: 
I got inspired to create the theme of my website after doing our video exercise with my group. The video we created led to the decision of what colors, description, and tones I wanted my website to have. In the video, we pretended to be in an Art Gallery in NYUAD where we showed various art pieces and projects that students have done in the past years. I wanted my website colors and theme to be pleasing to the eyes, just like the art pieces/projects were in the video trailer. I always thought of museams as a place that is pleasing to the eyes, a calm and peaceful tone throughout. This idea inspired me to create the website I wanted, with the layout, colors, size of text, and the way the video and photos of the Art Gallery gets presented.

## Website Concept:
My website starts off with a main page, welcoming the audience into the space of the Art Gallery. I have creater a header with the different pages including a HOME, ABOUT, VIDEO, and CONTACT page for the user to directly move to a specific page if they wanted to. If the user scolls down, he or she will see a 'scroll here' text and when they scroll the text will change and show them a cute text. Further below I have added a footer, with ny name to show that I am the creater of this website. I have also placed a NEXT button for the user to transfer to the second page. In the second page, I have added short bullet point descriptions of the Art Gallery and images below for the audience to get an idea of what the Gallery is about and what they will be expecting the next page, which will be the video trailer. In the third page I have added the video of the Art Gallery trailer which is displayed as a YouTube video. I first had to publish the video in YouTube then I added a link for it to dispaly on my website. Finally, in the last page, I have added some behind the scenes photos and me and group's contact emails for the audeince to email us about anything they wish to ask or say.

## Some important contributors I used in my website:
I firstly worked with HTML, where I set up class, div, header, footer, images, videos, and texts that I wanted to display throughout my website. Secondly, I worked with CSS, where I added the background, the button designing since I wanted it to have a specific color, shape, and shadow effect, I also added the texts' sizes, fonts, and colors which were different depending on whether it was a title, sub-title, or a description on the website. Thirdly, I worked with Javascript, where I added in the first page. The effect I used was that if the used scrolled on a specific text that read 'scroll here' then the texxt would change, giving the user a secret message.

## Hardships and Coding process:
I have faced several challenges during my coding process. 
- One challenge I have faced was that the header kept appearing at the top instead of at the bottom. I spent nearly two hours trying to figure out why the header was at the bottom even after adding the float code. I later found out that the reason that the header wasn't at the top wasn't because the code was wrong, but it was because the placement of the code should've been put before I added the layout code in that web page. 
- Another challenge I have faced was that when I wanted to add the scrolling effect on the pages, I had to put all the HTML pages in one page. This took a long time and it messed up my code in the end so I decided to remove the code for the scrolling effect.
- A third challenge I have faced was with java script, where I couldn't find a simple code to fit in my webiste. After a lot of researching and thinking, I have decided to use a code that would change the text when the user scrolled on that text.

## Code and Code Explanation: 
For the code, I seperated four HTML tabs for each page, then I created a CSS file for all the designs since some of them had the same elements. Then I finally added the Javascript, which was only a few lines of code. For each HTML tab, I added some importnat arributes that I needed for my website which were quite similar since I used the same process of text, class, div, etc. The CSS file contained similar but different designs for each page as well. I tried to organize my code by making sure to add comments and a nice layout, and it turned out to look pretty neat.

## Design: 
For the design, I first started to experiment with different colors for the website. I went for soft tones that included beige, yellow beige, grey, brown beige. Playing with different beige colors turned out to compliment each other and I loved how it turned out to look like. For the yellow beige, I decided to use it to add lines to give the pages more character for the page not to be too plain. I used the beige as the background because I wanted to compliment the other beige colors and the grey as well. I used the brown beige and grey for the colors because tey were a bit darker than the beige and yellow beige so the text would show clearly and the user wouldn't have any problems while reading the texts. For the images, I decided to place them  evenly in a square shape position.

## Conclusion:
In conclusion, this project had a lot of ups and downs. I loved the fact that it was challenging because it forced me to make mistakes and fixed the errors. However, the challenging part did take me long hours and long nights for me to work with, thankfully I managed to fix most of the challenges and I was very proud of it. This was my first ever website that I have created, and even though it took many days, lots of errors, and tons of code writing, I was very proud of the output I have ended up with. I showed my friends and family my website and I got tons of positive feedback, and some comments of what I could improve upon in the future.

## Improvements I want to make in the future:
Some improvements I want to make in the suture would be: 
- Description behind images when the mouse touches the image.
- Sliding effect for each page when the user clicks next.
- Cute shaped mouse that the user can see in the screen.
- A comment a user can send me for feedback.
