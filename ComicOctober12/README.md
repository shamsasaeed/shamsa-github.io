## Introduction:

We started off by brainstorming different ideas on what exactly we wanted our comic to be about. Initially we thought of recreating well known novels that we were very fond of as children. However we decided to take a different route that is original and unique to us.

First of all we took into consideration the comic’s sensibility and focused on incorporating the comic principles, as per McCloud’s guidelines, early on in the process of scripting our comic so that we make sure we deliver a story that is visually pleasant, easily understood, entertaining to the reader, and mainly carrying a moral of some sort. 

Together, we worked on coming up with an idea for the story, and then finally decided to create one that revolves around the journey of a dollar bill, starting from the moment tit leaves the wallet to the different events it encounters including a theft. 

This story we created was simple but its moral value is quite significant. It has the reader question the morality and the ethicality of certain actions. Is it okay to steal if your intentions are to save someone who’s sick? Such questions are not easily posed, especially when the narrative appears quite simple. However, we worked in a creative manner to stick to McCloud’s guidelines that emphasize the importance of simplicity while also delivering a powerful message. 

## Process and Challenges:

The process of our project consisted of regular meetings through which we discussed our different parts and combined our works together. The first part was of course creating the wireframe, which after discussing our comic, Shaikha took the initiative to create on the designing website Canva. 

Moving forward we began working on the coding as well as display aspect of our actual website. Ensuring that we created original content and not utilized visuals that were remade by different websites, Shaikha began by sketching out the outline of the characters using Illustrator and Dhabia edited a set of backgrounds using Photoshop. Below are images that portray the process:

Choosing the black outline for the characters was a stylistic choice that we made to give our comic the conventional comic book look. This was quite challenging at first, especially when trying to layer the characters on top of backgrounds, that is because the backgrounds were initially quite bright in color, making the characters hardly visible. We fixed this issue by increasing the blurriness of the images on Photoshop and lowering their saturation. Below are images that show the difference between our initial panels and our current:

Once we were done with preparing the visual aspect of the panels we went into the coding mechanics of the website. Following the tutorials, as well as the code references on BrightSpace, Shamsa worked on creating the scrolling animation effect with the backgrounds. Initially learning this process was somewhat challenging for all of us, however since we had the homework prior to this project, we had all become familiar with the way in which we were meant to create this effect effectively. 

With that said there were a few things that are worth being pointed out as principles that were learnt through this process. First of all, a challenge that we encountered in the beginning was figuring out how to control the placement of the text. This made the comic visualization a bit messy since we could not move the text where we exactly wanted, it was placed under certain images and looked unpleasant, however after researching we found the code that helped us fix that issue. Another challenge was the specific part that was responsible for granting the dollar bill the effect of flying into the panel. It was a bit of challenge to figure out how to direct the dollar bill and have it enter from different sides of the panel, however that issue was also resolved after testing out different codes. I will be placing an example below of the text placement.

Finally, this is what that portion of code looked like, and it worked perfectly for what we were planning:
(Attach piece of code) Moving on from there we began incorporating the visuals of our characters onto the backgrounds. Shaikha was responsible for that part of the animation, she worked on splitting the outlines of the characters from the dollar bills to code each one separately and have the dollar bill enter into the panel in an animated manner.
	
Initially the reliance was mainly on the tutorials available on BrightSpace, however further research for different ways to perform different effects was required, website that helped us was [this](https://www.w3schools.com/) website. Through the research that was done, the part of link for some of the code was the example shown below which was inspired.

Once the basic look of our website was complete Shahad took the role of scripting the narrative of the story that we had come up with as a group, and then handed that script to Shamsa who was responsible for incorporating it into the panels of our comic. At first, to give very specific details and to attempt to deliver the moral of the story directly, Shahad wrote relatively long paragraphs for each panel. Taking Professor Banakou’s advice, and going back to McCloud’s comic guidelines, we realized that incorporating long paragraphs might not be the best element to our project especially since the targeted audience is fairly young, and chunks of text would not appear visually interesting to them. As a result we decided to shorten the length of our paragraphs and limit them to a few short lines.

To compensate for that loss and ensure that the moral of the story is still well understood by the reader while also being far more entertaining, we decided to incorporate sound effects. For this part we relied on the code available on BrightSpace. Dhabia worked on creating different audio files through combining a set of readily available sound effects on the web. These sound effects were then added onto the different panels as layers of interactivity wherein the users are welcome to play the different sound effects as they read through the comic. 

Finally, we met and discussed the project as a whole and looked at the final result as shown below while also getting the opinion of friends to see what could be improved or changed.

## Things We Learnt:

We learnt quite a few things in terms of how to create comic’s in the best visually attractive and morally significant way. We followed the steps listed by McCloud closely when making decisions on the visual aspect of the panels as well as the written content. 

In terms of coding, specific challenges are listed above, but in general we learnt how to effectively create the parallax and the scrolling animation effect. We also learnt how to utilize elements that we have not specifically covered in class, that is the effects used on the dollar bill. While that was a bit challenging, it was our way of pushing ourselves creatively. 

Furthermore, we became more comfortable with using Illustrator and Photoshop and learnt how to use tools that we were not aware of earlier. One more important thing that we learnt is how to compensate for whatever we decide to remove from our website and how to do that in a very creative manner using audios and sound effects. 

While this was a project that we created under a very tight schedule, we are all satisfied with the final result and most importantly are satisfied with the amount of knowledge we gained through the process.
