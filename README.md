## Art Gallery Musuem 

## Inspiration: 
I got inspired to create the theme of my website after doing our video exercise with my group. The video we created led to the decision of what colors, description, and tones I wanted my website to have. In the video, we pretended to be in an Art Gallery in NYUAD where we showed various art pieces and projects that students have done in the past years. I wanted my website colors and theme to be pleasing to the eyes, just like the art pieces/projects were in the video trailer. I always thought of museams as a place that is pleasing to the eyes, a calm and peaceful tone throughout. This idea inspired me to create the website I wanted, with the layout, colors, size of text, and the way the video and photos of the Art Gallery gets presented.

## Website Concept:
My website starts off with a main page, welcoming the audience into the space of the Art Gallery. I have creater a header with the different pages including a HOME, ABOUT, VIDEO, and CONTACT page for the user to directly move to a specific page if they wanted to. If the user scolls down, he or she will see a 'scroll here' text and when they scroll the text will change and show them a cute text. Further below I have added a footer, with ny name to show that I am the creater of this website. I have also placed a NEXT button for the user to transfer to the second page. In the second page, I have added short bullet point descriptions of the Art Gallery and images below for the audience to get an idea of what the Gallery is about and what they will be expecting the next page, which will be the video trailer. In the third page I have added the video of the Art Gallery trailer which is displayed as a YouTube video. I first had to publish the video in YouTube then I added a link for it to dispaly on my website. Finally, in the last page, I have added some behind the scenes photos and me and group's contact emails for the audeince to email us about anything they wish to ask or say.

Thirdly, I worked with Javascript, where I

## Hardships and Coding process:
I have faced several challenges during my coding process. For example, 

## Code and Code Explanation: 
For the code, I seperated four HTML tabs for each page, then I created a CSS file for all the designs since some of them had the same elements.

## Design: 
For the design, I first started to exxperiment with different colors for the website.

## Conclusion:
In conclusion, this was my first ever website that I have created, and even though it took many days, lots of errors, and tons of code writing, I was very proud of the output I have ended up with.

## Improvements I want to make in the future:
Some improvements I want to make in the suture would be: 
- Description behind images when the mouse touches the image.
- Sliding effect for each page when the user clicks next.
- Cute shaped mouse that the user can see in the screen.
- A comment a user can send me for feedback.
