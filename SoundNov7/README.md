### Project Concept and Summary

### Process and Coding 

Choosing the theme of the website that is appropriate to the mood of our soundscape was the most challenging part of coding. We initially designed the website to be in a simple playlist style (like that of Spotify), but we felt the website must hint to visitors that our audio is about cellphones. For this reason, we slightly modified our design so that the visitors can use the cellphone image as a play button as shown above. Using HTML and CSS, I was able to make a page that shows a smartphone with a play button. Instead of putting a play button that we see in most video players, I decided to use a headphone image to make sure visitors are aware that only sound will be played. Using Javascript, I was able to make an audio play and stop when the button is clicked. 

<em>Character bubbles</em> that are floating around the page while the audio is playing are solely made using Javascript. Using a Javascript feature that allows me to keep track of time in milliseconds, I made bubbles move in a random initial direction by certain pixels every 100ms and bounce off when they hit the border. Making certain bubbles appear and disappear was done by making bubbles visible or hidden at a specific time. These specific times were manually written down on the paper after the soundscape was done. I went through several trial-and-error processes to make the timing perfect.

### Sound recording and effect

### Design and Conclusion

On the first page, we placed a phone to make the audience wonder why we chose to do that, this will be revealed later on in the story. After the sliding effect of the phone, the user would be brought to the second page. For the character images, we made them look like bubbles so that they could float around the screen. Since the images had movement across the screen already, we made the background a simple color, red. This is because we wanted to make sure that the user would not get too distracted as they listened to the audio. This could potentially lead to losing focus on the storyline which is something we definitely wanted to avoid doing. We chose the color red because this color represents a sign of danger or warning, and that is a message we wanted to convey to the audience. The colors of the characters are also bold, we made the color scheme that way in the website because we wanted to show that this story will be empowering and portray something important. We matched the color scheme by using the background, bubbles, and the phone display as well.

In conclusion, we have crossed through many stages in this sound project starting from thinking about the story, writing out the script and the character's lines, recording the sound, adding the effects, editing the sound into the effect, developing the website with CSS, HTML, and JavaScript, then finally finalizing the website with the sound audio. Even though all these stages took a lot of group meeting, individual tasks etc it was worth it in the end because of how we put all of the elements together in a group work form. Working in a group helps to lsiten to different ideas and collaborate with problem solving and sharing ideas. For example, we actually had a couple of ideas for the storyline but with our group discussions and reasons, we decided to stick the story line we did and we are proud that we did because the output we created is something that we are all proud of.
